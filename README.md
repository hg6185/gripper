# Towards the OpenSource printed industrial Robot

## About this project

I started this project, because I wanted to work on industrial robots at home. Furthermore with a webcam and YOLOv8 the gripper is detected. The aim is to detect when an object is between the gripper.
Sofar, this project, due to its cost and the beginning of my masterthesis, was temporarily paused. \n

Current status:
  - gripper printed
  - serial connection with arduino in the code
  - Yolo-style labled dataset
